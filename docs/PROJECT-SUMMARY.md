### What Makes This Site Look Premium (Not "Cheap")

#### 1. Typography Excellence

- **Body Font:** Inter (clean, modern sans-serif)
- **Proper hierarchy:** Clear size and weight distinctions
- **Readable line heights:** 1.6-1.7 for body text
- **Responsive sizing:** Uses clamp() for fluid typography

#### 2. Sophisticated Color Palette
```
Primary Blue:   #2D5A7B (trust, professionalism)
Accent Coral:   #E8927C (warmth, approachability)
Text Dark:      #2C3E50 (excellent readability)
Background:     #FAF8F5 (soft cream, easy on eyes)
```
- Limited palette (5 main colors)
- High contrast ratios for accessibility
- Subtle gradients (not overdone)

#### 3. Organic Blob Shape for Profile Photo
- **Modern aesthetic:** Moving away from boring squares/circles
- **Animated:** Smooth morphing animation (8s loop)
- **Soft shadow:** Creates depth without being harsh
- **Responsive:** Scales beautifully on all devices

The blob shape is defined with:
```css
border-radius: 30% 70% 70% 30% / 30% 30% 70% 70%;
animation: blobMorph 8s ease-in-out infinite;
```

#### 4. Generous White Space
- Container max-width: 1200px (prevents content stretching on large screens)
- Consistent spacing system using CSS custom properties
- Sections have breathing room (3-6rem padding)
- Cards and elements aren't cramped

#### 5. Smooth Micro-Interactions
- **Transition timing:** 0.3s cubic-bezier (professional feel)
- **Hover effects:** Subtle translateY(-5px to -8px)
- **Button shadows:** Appear on hover for depth
- **Navigation underlines:** Animated from 0 to 100% width

#### 6. Professional Card Design
- Rounded corners (16-24px) - modern but not excessive
- Subtle shadows that increase on hover
- Border transitions on hover (transparent → accent color)
- Consistent padding throughout

#### 7. Modern CSS Techniques
- CSS Grid for layouts (not old float/table methods)
- Flexbox for alignment
- CSS Custom Properties (variables) for maintainability
- Modern responsive design (mobile-first)
- No Bootstrap or heavy frameworks (cleaner code)
